<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->

## About The Project

This project is developed under the course IAAC: AI 2023-24 at [IAAC](https://iaac.net/).

### Concept Statement

This research examines how policies in the world powers affect AI strategies and self-regulation in leading tech companies (the Big Nine). It explores the potential for AI to help regulate itself, given its understanding of its own systems and potential general intelligence. The project aims to highlight the need for ethical AI policies and international cooperation for the benefit of humanity.

### Project Breakdown

This code is for a Streamlit application that allows users to upload PDF documents, extract the text from those documents, and use that text to answer user questions. The application uses OpenAI embeddings to convert the text into a format that can be used for information retrieval. The handle_userinput function generates responses to user questions based on the text from the uploaded PDFs.

## Getting Started

To get a local copy up and running, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository**
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/your_username_/Project-Name.git
    ```

2. **Navigate to the project directory**
    ```sh
    cd Project-Name
    ```

3. **Create a Python virtual environment**
    ```sh
    python -m venv .venv
    ```

4. **Activate the virtual environment**
    - On Windows, use:
        ```sh
        . .\.venv\Scripts\activate
        ```
    - On Unix or MacOS, use:
        ```sh
        source .venv/bin/activate
        ```

5. **Add your Keys .env file**
    - In the project directory, add your key in the file named `.env`.
    - Open the `.env` file and add your OpenAI and Hugging Face API keys like this:
        ```sh
        OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key
        HUGGINGFACE_API_TOKEN=your_huggingface_api_token
        ```
    - Save the `.env` file. **Do not** commit this file to your repository. It contains sensitive information.

6. **Run the Streamlit app**
    ```sh
    streamlit run app.py
    ```

### Deactivation

When you're done working, you can deactivate the virtual environment by running:
```sh
ctrl + c
